## Element app number 1

```xml
<app from="#d001w9" to="#d001w13" type="margin-note">
    <lem source="#lb1-56" type="ancient-note">
        <add type="abstract"><emph style="font-style:italic">Meditaris</emph> cantas, uel <emph style="font-style:italic">melitaris</emph>, -<emph style="font-style:italic">l</emph>- pro -<emph style="font-style:italic">d</emph>-, ut idem sit tropus.</add>
    </lem>
</app>
```

Here is the corresponding log:

```txt
[INF] Parsing C:\Users\dfusi\Desktop\mqdq\VERG-eclo-app.xml
[INF] ==Parsing div1 #d001 at line 358
[INF] --Parsing app #1@370
[INF] Fragment location: 3.1-3.5
[INF] Item ID set to 93202
[INF] -Parsing lem@371
[INF] Completed fragment 3.1-3.5 [1]: replacement: * (_Meditaris_ cantas, uel _melitaris_, -_l_- pro -_d_-, ut idem sit tropus.) lb1-56
```

The log starts with the input filename, and records each `div` and `app` element with its line number. Each app corresponds to a fragment; thus, the log first of all records its location, as derived from its attributes.

Also, given that this is the first part, a corresponding item to contain it is created and the part's item ID is set to its ID. Then, the log starts parsing the `app` element's content; here it just finds a `lem` element.

Finally, once all the content elements have been processed, providing a number of various entries in the fragment, the fragment itself is logged as completed with its location, count of entries, and entries summary.

If we look at the first part output in the dump JSON file, we find no such fragment. This is because it is a `margin-note` fragment, and as such it belongs to another layer, i.e. another part, which gets output after the first one.

In fact, immediately after the first part we find another one, whose role is `fr.it.vedph.apparatus:margin` (in Cadmus, layer parts have as role the type ID of their fragment model, followed by a colon plus a role ID when present).

If we look at the source text document, the base text portion is verse 2:

```xml
<l xml:id="d001l3" n="2">
    <w xml:id="d001w9">siluestrem</w>
    <w xml:id="d001w10">tenui</w>
    <w xml:id="d001w11">musam</w>
    <w xml:id="d001w12">meditaris</w>
    <w xml:id="d001w13">auena:</w>
</l>
```

The above apparatus refers to the whole verse, from `siluestrem` to `auena`. The corresponding tiled-text is a row (Y=3 i.e. the third line, because line 1 is the speaker's name) with 5 tiles, one for each word:

```json
{
    "y": 3,
    "tiles": [
    {
        "x": 1,
        "data": { "id": "d001w9", "text": "siluestrem" }
    },
    {
        "x": 2,
        "data": { "id": "d001w10", "text": "tenui" }
    },
    {
        "x": 3,
        "data": { "id": "d001w11", "text": "musam" }
    },
    {
        "x": 4,
        "data": { "id": "d001w12", "text": "meditaris" }
    },
    {
        "x": 5,
        "data": { "id": "d001w13", "text": "auena:" }
    }
    ],
    "data": { "_name": "l", "id": "d001l3", "n": "2"  }
}
```

Thus, we expect the fragment location to be `3.1-3.5`, i.e. line 3, words from 1 to 5. In fact, the first fragment in the output part is:

```json
{
    "location": "3.1-3.5",
    "tag": "d001 margin-note",
    "entries": [
    {
        "type": 3,
        "tag": "ancient-note",
        "value": null,
        "normValue": null,
        "isAccepted": false,
        "groupId": null,
        "witnesses": [],
        "authors": [
        {
            "value": "lb1-56",
            "note": null
        }
        ],
        "note": "_Meditaris_ cantas, uel _melitaris_, -_l_- pro -_d_-, ut idem sit tropus."
    }
    ]
}
```

Here:

- the location is as expected.
- the tag is the combination of the `div1`'s ID (`d001`) and the `app`'s type (`margin-note`).
- the apparatus entries contain a single entry: its type is `3` (=note), as for any entry in the margin notes apparatus (unless they are provided with a value, which anyway I suppose should not happen).
- there are no witnesses, and a single author `lb1-56`.
- the note's text contains only section 1 (which corresponds to the `add` element with `@type`=`abstract`), and thus has no section separators. It is transformed so that the formatting is expressed with Markdown (text between underscores is italic). Thus, the original XML element:

```xml
<add type="abstract"><emph style="font-style:italic">Meditaris</emph> cantas, uel <emph style="font-style:italic">melitaris</emph>, -<emph style="font-style:italic">l</emph>- pro -<emph style="font-style:italic">d</emph>-, ut idem sit tropus.</add>
```

becomes:

```txt
_Meditaris_ cantas, uel _melitaris_, -_l_- pro -_d_-, ut idem sit tropus.
```

## Element app number 2

The second `app` element contains 2 variants and 1 ancient note, all referred to a single word (`siluestrem`):

```xml
<app from="#d001w9" to="#d001w9">
    <lem wit="#lw1-16 #lw1-21">siluestrem</lem>
    <rdg source="#lb1-50 #lb1-25">agrestem
        <note type="details" target="#lb1-50"> 9, 4, 85,</note>
        <note type="details" target="#lb1-25"> SI 244</note>
        <ident n="d001w9">AGRESTEM</ident>
    </rdg>
    <rdg source="#lb1-56" type="ancient-note">
        <add type="abstract"><emph style="font-style:italic">silvestrem</emph>, agrestem<emph style="font-style:italic">.</emph></add>
    </rdg>
</app>
```

The log reports the 3 parsed elements, and a potential overlap for the fragment, as `d001w9` is already included in the previous `app`. This is only an information (`[INF]`), not an error, because the overlap is resolved by moving ancient notes to a different layer.

```txt
[INF] --Parsing app #2@375
[INF] Fragment location: 3.1
[INF] -Parsing lem@376
[INF] -Parsing rdg@377
[INF] -Parsing rdg@382
[INF] Overlap for new fragment at 3.1 (original #d001w9-#d001w9): replacement: siluestrem* lw1-16 lw1-21; replacement: agrestem lb1-50 (``9, 4, 85,) lb1-25 (``SI 244); replacement:  (_silvestrem_, agrestem_._) lb1-56
[INF] Completed fragment 3.1 [3]: replacement: siluestrem* lw1-16 lw1-21; replacement: agrestem lb1-50 (``9, 4, 85,) lb1-25 (``SI 244); replacement:  (_silvestrem_, agrestem_._) lb1-56
```

Here is the fragment corresponding to the variants: the first entry corresponds to `lem` (`isAccepted` is true, with 2 witnesses), the second to `rdg`:

```json
{
    "location": "3.1",
    "tag": "d001",
    "entries": [
    {
        "type": 0,
        "tag": null,
        "value": "siluestrem",
        "normValue": null,
        "isAccepted": true,
        "groupId": null,
        "witnesses": [
            { "value": "lw1-16", "note": null },
            { "value": "lw1-21", "note": null }
        ],
        "authors": [],
        "note": null
    },
    {
        "type": 0,
        "tag": null,
        "value": "agrestem",
        "normValue": "AGRESTEM#d001w9",
        "isAccepted": false,
        "groupId": null,
        "witnesses": [],
        "authors": [
            { "value": "lb1-50", "note": "`` 9, 4, 85," },
            { "value": "lb1-25", "note": "`` SI 244" }
        ],
        "note": null
    }
    ]
}
```

The second entry also has a normalized value with its ID appended after `#` (both derived from `ident`), and 2 authors derived from `rdg`'s `source` attribute. Both these have a note, derived from elements `note` with attribute `type`=`details`. This combination corresponds to note section 3, so their text is preceded by 2 section separators (backticks). Note that all the whitespaces are preserved.

## Part Completion

As you can see, the fragments are being accumulated in the same layer part(s) (from 1 to 3, according to the layer involved). The part is complete only when all the fragments related to the item's base text have been imported.

This happens when the importer encounters the first `app` element whose text reference points to text whose item ID is different from the current one. This means that from that element onwards all the fragments will refer to that item, and thus require a new set of layers assigned to it.

In the log, this change is signaled by an "Item ID changed" message, followed by the summary of the parts collected for the preceding item:

```txt
[INF] Item ID changed from 86525717-d507-4d6f-98e6-95806b793202 to 8c69284e-88e4-4441-bba2-6e23a345f2f9
[INF] Completed PART [fr.it.vedph.apparatus] 1-415: 3.1, 15.3, 16.1
[INF] Completed PART [fr.it.vedph.apparatus:margin] 1-415: 3.1-3.5, 16.1-16.8
```

Here we switch to the second item, identifed by its ID (you can find it in the text JSON dump files). The previous item has 2 parts: one as the "standard" apparatus (role `fr.it.vedph.apparatus`); another as the margin notes apparatus (role `fr.it.vedph.apparatus:margin`).

The first part has 3 fragments, at the specified coordinates. The second part has 3 fragments, too; note that some of the coordinates of the first part overlap with these of the second, but this is not an issue given that these are two different layers.
